# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Built with:

- ReactJS
- React-Router-Dom
- Chakra UI

## Things to do as soon as possible :

It seems that the rest API [(https://restcountries.com/v2/all)] has been modified with [(https://countrylayer.com)] which may cause some errors, but soon I will try to make requests with it.

1. Put a loading message before the data is displayed

2. Stylization problem in the Details page especially ( congo, Korea, Tanzania )

3. The possibility to click on the bordering country and to display the details of this last one

I'll try to fix it as soon as possible !
